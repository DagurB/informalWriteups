## Gameplan
use known pt to symbolically walk the cipher forwards.

This should result in a poly-over-poly state element.

Since the subkeys are 64 bit elements, we can't brute them or anything like that

Let $x/y$ and $z/w$ be two state elements, and $c_0$ and $c_1$ be the corresponding ciphertexts. The subkeys should be roots of both $x/y - c_0$ and $z/w - c_1$.

By trivial algebraic manipulation, we get that $x - c_0 * y$ and $z - c_1*w$ must also have the subkeys as roots.

Since, afaik, there is no good way of doing gcd for multivariate polynomial rings, we have to use gr√∂ber. This may not work due to how ungodly slow it is.

UPDATE:

Instead of walking all the way forwards, we walk the pt halfway forwards, and the ct halfway backwards, that should result smaller degree polynomials.
